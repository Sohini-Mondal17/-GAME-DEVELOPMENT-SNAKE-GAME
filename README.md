*DESCRIPTION*:This C++ console-based Snake game demonstrates the use of core programming concepts and system-level utilities for game development without external graphics libraries. It showcases how to build interactive applications using the Standard Template Library (STL) and basic input/output operations. Below is an overview of the tools used, development environment, and where such a project can be applied.

Tools and Technologies Used
1. Programming Language – C++
This project is built entirely using C++, a powerful language known for its efficiency and control over system resources. C++ allows both low-level memory manipulation and high-level object-oriented programming. In this game, the following standard C++ libraries are used:

<iostream>: Handles basic input and output operations.

<deque>: Used to store the snake's body efficiently, allowing fast insertions and deletions at both ends.

<vector> and <cstdlib>: Assist with random number generation and dynamic storage.

<chrono> and <thread>: Included to support time-related operations and delays (though not actively used for speed control in the current version).

<ctime>: Used to seed the random number generator for placing food in different locations.

2. Terminal Control with ANSI Escape Codes
This game uses ANSI escape sequences like \033[2J\033[1;1H to clear and redraw the terminal screen each frame. This mimics animation without needing a graphics engine. It works on most terminals that support ANSI sequences, such as Linux terminal emulators and Windows Command Prompt (with virtual terminal sequences enabled).

Editor Platform and Environment
This code can be developed and executed in any modern C++ environment. Popular options include:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with a C++ extension, paired with a compiler like g++ or clang. VS Code is widely used due to its speed, integrated terminal, and IntelliSense support.

CLion, Dev C++, or Code::Blocks – full-featured C++ IDEs.

Command-line tools on GNU/Linux with g++, or on Windows using MinGW or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

Because the game uses standard C++ and terminal text rendering, it is platform-independent and can run on nearly any system with a terminal and C++ compiler.

Applications and Use Cases
1. Game Logic Fundamentals
This project introduces key game development concepts such as movement control, collision detection, a continuous game loop, and scorekeeping—skills foundational to more complex 2D game creation.

2. Data Structures
Using a deque highlights efficient handling of dynamic data structures in real-time, ideal for simulating a growing snake.

3. Terminal-Based Applications
Techniques used here can apply to:

Console games

Text-based tools and utilities

Simple system monitoring interfaces

4. Learning Tool
This game serves as a practical way for students to learn about loops, conditionals, enums, structs, and input handling—key programming fundamentals. It also introduces the concept of state machines, essential in software engineering.
